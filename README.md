## üìå Problem Statement

Preparing for technical interviews often lacks structured feedback and realism.
Traditional methods like self-practice or generic interview question banks fail to simulate real-world scenarios and do not provide personalized growth insights.

## üí° Approach & Solution

We designed an AI-Powered Interview Platform to simulate mock interviews, evaluate responses in real time,
and generate detailed feedback reports. The system leverages Google Gemini AI for dynamic question generation and answer evaluation,
Firebase for secure user management and data storage, and is fully built on the MERN stack for scalability and performance.
